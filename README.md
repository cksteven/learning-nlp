# learning-nlp
My repo for python notebooks on NLP stuff (using binder). 

Open EXISTING Jupyter Notebook: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/cksteven/nlp-binder-env/master?urlpath=git-pull?repo=https://github.com/cksteven/learning-nlp)

To open Jupyter Lab with EXISTING contents, wait until server is launched, and manually replace `tree` in the url with `lab`.
